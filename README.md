## Login page :- 
##### Login Page is very common among any type of secured applications and its widely used on the internet for authenticating the user before presenting the secured pages of the web applications. For example to use Facebook you have to get authenticated by the Facebook before they give you access to their platform. The user authentication is done through a special web page called Login Page. The Login page asks you to enter your credentials which is then validated by the application and after successful validation you are presented with the secured part of the application.

## SignUp page :- 
##### A signup page (also known as a registration page) enables users and organizations to independently register and gain access to your system. It is common to have multiple signup pages depending on the types of people and organizations you want to register.

## JWT Token
### Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:
#### Authorization: 
##### This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.
#### Information Exchange:
##### JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
